# Cover Making Application

A full-stack web application for managing custom fabric covers for musical instruments, calculating prices, and generating marketplace listing templates.

## Overview

This application helps manage:
- Manufacturers, series, and equipment models with dimensions
- Material types with cost, weight, and labor time properties
- Customers and orders with line items
- Pricing calculations (area, material cost, labor, options, shipping)
- Amazon template import and management

## Key Features

1. **Pricing Calculator**: Calculates cover costs based on:
   - Surface area: 2*(W×D + W×H + D×H) with 5% waste
   - Material cost per square inch
   - Labor cost (material labor time × hourly rate)
   - Option surcharges (handle zipper, two-in-one pocket, music rest)
   - Shipping rates by carrier and zone

2. **Amazon Template Import**: Parses Excel files to extract:
   - Data Definitions (field names, requirements)
   - Valid Values for each field
   - Default Values (custom defaults with placeholder support)
   - Item type keywords

3. **Parent SKU Generation**: Auto-generates 40-character parent/base SKUs when models are saved:
   - Format: `MFGR(8)-SERIES(8)-MODEL(13)V1 + zeros`
   - Multi-word names are concatenated and camelCased
   - Short names are padded with X's
   - Example: `FENDERXX-TONEMAST-SUPERREVERBXXV10000000`
   - Endpoint `POST /models/regenerate-skus` to backfill existing models

4. **Dynamic Pricing Options System**:
   - Pricing options are add-on features (e.g., Handle Zipper, Two-in-One Pocket, Music Rest Zipper)
   - Create, edit, and delete pricing options through the Pricing Options page
   - Assign specific pricing options to equipment types via the Equipment Types page
   - Junction table `equipment_type_pricing_options` manages many-to-many relationship

5. **Dynamic Design Options System**:
   - Design options define product design features (e.g., Handle Options, Angle Options)
   - Create, edit, and delete design options through the Design Options page
   - Assign specific design options to equipment types via the Equipment Types page
   - Junction table `equipment_type_design_options` manages many-to-many relationship
   - Default design options: "Handle Options" (for handle location selection), "Angle Options" (for angle/curve type selection)

## Development

The application runs on:
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend: http://localhost:5000 (proxied to backend)

## Database

SQLite database with the following main tables:
- manufacturers, series, equipment_types, models
- materials, material_colour_surcharges
- suppliers, supplier_materials
- customers, orders, order_lines
- pricing_options, shipping_rates, equipment_type_pricing_options (junction table)
- design_options, equipment_type_design_options (junction table)
- amazon_product_types, product_type_fields, product_type_field_values

## Database Migrations

The project uses Alembic for database migrations:

```bash
# Generate a new migration after model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Rollback one migration
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Seeding Data

To populate the database with initial data:

```bash
python -c "from app.seed_data import seed_database; seed_database()"
```

This adds default equipment types, materials, pricing options, shipping rates, and sample manufacturers/series/models.
